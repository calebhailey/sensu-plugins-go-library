## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added CHANGELOG.md
- Added support for Check plugins

### Changed
- Removed redundant `basePlugin.eventMandatory` struct field which duplicates
  the purpose of the `basePlugin.readEvent` field (i.e. used to indicate whether
  the plugin should wait to read from stdin; this flag is required for Handler
  and Mutator plugins, but optional for Check plugins)
- Refactored plugin library to remove "Go" function and type name prefixes (i.e.
  "GoHandler" is now just "Handler")
- Renamed "New" functions to "Init" functions (e.g. "NewGoHandler" is now more
  appropriately named "InitHandler")
  - `NewGoHandler` is now `InitHandler`
  - `NewGoMutator` is now `InitMutator`
  _NOTE: this is a backwards-incompatible change. Please update your plugins to
  initialize using the "sensu.InitHandler" method instead of the
  "sensu.NewGoHandler" method._
